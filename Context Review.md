# V2 Credit Spread Algorithm - Context Review

## Project Overview
Development of a quantitative trading algorithm for SPY options, focusing on bull put credit spreads. The system is being built with a modular architecture for maintainability and flexibility.

## Development Progress
### Current Stage
- **Module Implementation Phase**
- Recently completed OrderExecutor module
- Currently implementing Risk Manager module

### Completed Components
1. **Order Execution System**
   - Bull put spread order placement
   - Position management
   - Order event handling

2. **Risk Management Foundation**
   - Basic risk parameter definitions
   - Initial Risk Manager class structure
   - Integration points with main algorithm

## Risk Management Implementation
### Current Status
- Risk Manager module is in active development
- Basic structure is in place but not fully functional
- Integration with main algorithm started

### Key Components
1. **Risk Parameters**
   - Stop-loss threshold: 2Ã— initial credit (not yet working)
   - Position sizing logic (in progress)
   - Risk limits (to be implemented)

2. **Architecture**
   - Separated from OrderExecutor to maintain single responsibility
   - Designed for easy extension of risk rules

## Stop-Logic Implementation
### Current State
- **Stop-Loss Not Yet Functional**
  - Basic structure in place but not triggering
  - Requires debugging and testing
  - Need to verify calculation of exit conditions

### Next Steps for Stop-Loss
1. Debug stop-loss triggering logic
2. Add comprehensive logging
3. Test with edge cases
4. Verify proper position closure

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Complete stop-loss functionality
2. Add comprehensive logging for risk events

## Future Work
3. Implement take-profit logic
4. Test risk management in various market conditions

# Proposed Next Steps for Algorithm Enhancement

This document outlines the agreed-upon order for implementing new features and enhancements to the trading algorithm.

## Implementation Phases and Order:

**Phase 1: Refining the Current Bull Put Spread Strategy**

1.  **Take Profit Parameter:**
    *   Implement a mechanism to close trades when they reach a predefined percentage of the maximum potential profit (initial credit received).

2.  **Entry Timing Change:**
    *   Modify the scheduled trade entry time to experiment with different market conditions (e.g., early afternoon).

**Phase 2: Introducing Market Direction**

3.  **Simple Directional Indicator:**
    *   Implement a basic directional indicator (e.g., SMA crossover) to inform trade decisions.

**Phase 3: Expanding to Bidirectional Trading**

4.  **Bidirectional Trading:**
    *   Incorporate logic for Bear Call Spreads, allowing the strategy to trade based on the determined market direction (bullish or bearish).

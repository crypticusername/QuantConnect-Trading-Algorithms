## Technical Implementation Details

## Phase 1: Basic Framework Setup
- Use `self.set_start_date()` and `self.set_end_date()` with appropriate dates
- Set cash with `self.set_cash(100000)` for initial testing
- Set time zone with `self.set_time_zone(TimeZones.EASTERN_STANDARD)`
- Add SPY equity with `self.add_equity("SPY", Resolution.MINUTE)`
- Add SPY options with `self.add_option("SPY", Resolution.MINUTE)`
- Set up warm-up period with `self.set_warm_up(10, Resolution.DAILY)` for accurate Greeks calculation
- Create logging helper methods for debugging and trade tracking
- Implement `OnData()` event handler for market data processing
- Schedule entry at 10:30 AM ET and exit at 3:30 PM ET

## Phase 2: Option Chain Filtering & Expiration Control
- Implement option chain filter with `opt.set_filter(lambda u: u.include_weeklys().strikes(-n,n).expiration(0,0))`
- Create helper method `get_same_day_expiry()` to identify 0-DTE options
- Implement strike selection based on delta target (0.30 ± 0.05)
- Add functionality to dynamically adjust strike range based on implied volatility (IV)
- Create method to verify option liquidity through bid-ask spread analysis
- Implement functions to extract and analyze option chain Greeks (delta, gamma, theta, vega)

## Phase 3: Credit Spread Construction
- Implement `create_bull_put_spread()` method using `OptionStrategies.bull_put_spread()`
- Implement `create_bear_call_spread()` method using `OptionStrategies.bear_call_spread()`
- Add delta targeting logic to select appropriate short strikes (~0.30 delta)
- Calculate spread width based on current implied volatility (IV)
- Add validation to ensure minimum credit threshold (25% of width)
- Create helper methods to calculate max loss per contract and risk/reward ratio
- Implement gamma exposure calculation to monitor potential rapid delta changes
- Add theta calculation to estimate time decay benefit

## Phase 4: Order Execution & Error Handling
- Implement `place_spread_order()` method with retry logic
- Add error handling for insufficient buying power and liquidity issues
- Implement order status tracking with `OnOrderEvent()`
- Create safeguards against partial fills and leg risk
- Add detailed logging for all order-related events including fills and slippage
- Implement circuit breakers for extreme market conditions (IV spikes)
- Add methods to handle assignment risk near expiration
- Create functions to calculate and monitor margin requirements

## Phase 5: Signal Generation & Position Sizing
- Store previous day's close in `Initialize()` or via history request
- Implement signal generation based on price comparison with previous close
- Create position sizing calculation: `contracts = floor((portfolio * 0.02) / max_loss_per_contract)`
- Add minimum contract check (at least 1 contract)
- Implement delta targeting (0.30 ± 0.05) for short leg selection
- Add IV percentile analysis to adjust position sizing in high volatility environments
- Create methods to calculate portfolio delta, gamma, and theta exposures
- Implement premium collection tracking and analysis

## Phase 6: Exit Management
- Implement continuous monitoring of spread positions and mark-to-market values
- Create stop-loss logic to close at 1.25× initial credit (75% loss of max profit)
- Schedule time-based exit at 3:30 PM ET to avoid assignment risk
- Add special handling for ITM spreads near expiration based on delta values
- Implement clean exit procedures to avoid pin risk at expiration
- Add performance tracking with Greeks exposure over time
- Create P&L attribution analysis (theta decay vs. directional moves)
- Implement volatility exposure management

## QuantConnect-Specific Considerations

- Option chain data may be delayed or incomplete for 0-DTE options in the morning
- OptionStrategies API requires specific syntax for proper margin calculation
- Assignment risk is not fully simulated in backtesting environment
- Greeks calculations may differ slightly from real-world values
- Slippage model may need adjustment for realistic 0-DTE option execution
- Consider using custom slippage model for more accurate backtesting
- Warm-up period is essential for accurate Greeks calculations

## Known Issues and Challenges

- 0-DTE options may have liquidity challenges, especially for further OTM strikes
- Rapid gamma exposure changes can cause unexpected losses in fast-moving markets
- Pin risk near expiration requires careful management
- Bid-ask spreads may be wider than expected for certain strikes
- IV crush or expansion can significantly impact spread values
- Partial fills may create leg risk that requires special handling
- Early assignment risk increases for ITM options near expiration
